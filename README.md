# Location Services in Android


### This app simply demonstrates the use of Google Maps and Location. By clicking on Restaurant's name you will be refered to their location on 
the Google map.

This app demonstrates how to show a location on the map using geocoding, longitude and latitude and highlight that location on the map using markers and annotations.

For using this app you will need to set up the Google Play Services on your Emulator. Need Help for that? ----> (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14536595/how-to-download-google-play-services-in-an-android-emulator)
